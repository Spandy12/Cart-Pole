# Cart-Pole
This project uses neural networks to play the game provided by OpenAI Gym, CartPole-v0. The machine initially, randomly makes moves and stores the output in a training data array, and this data is later used to train our model. So you can observe upon execution, how the machine tries to beat the game by developing intuition throughout the game, and keeps improving it's moves.

Tensorflow and python were used to build this model. Epoch has been set to 6. Just run the project through terminal/bash. Before running the model make sure tensorflow and python are installed.
